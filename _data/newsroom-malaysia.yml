  subtitle: 01 February 2016  detail: MCMC Chairman, Dato’ Sri Halim Shafie announced that frequency bands of 900 MHz and 1800 MHz will be assigned for a fee to Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile for a period of 15 years. MCMC intends to issue the spectrum assignment to all four players by August 2016 for full implementation by 1 July 2017. The reallocation and conversion to spectrum assignment provide more certainty on the length of time these four players will have the right to use this spectrum. Dato’ Sri Halim Shafie also stated that MCMC will also address the optimal usage of other relevant spectrum bands such as the 700MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz bands, etc. by the end of 2016.
